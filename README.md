# Apuleius Resources
Hopefully this will develop into a full commentary project on Apuleius' Metamorphoses. For now I'm storing a few things here so that others can use them if need be.
So far I have a complete vocab list and a fully lemmatized html text of the Metamorphoses. All lemmas point to entries in the vocab list. The text is from the Latin Library (with some corrections).
- Most of the lemmas were derived from the Bridge's digitization of Oldfather's concordance: https://github.com/GitClassical/Concordances 
- Almost all of the dictionary entries were derived from the Bridge's Latin master file: https://github.com/GitClassical/Bridge/tree/master/data
-allap.zip is 11 html files compressed with css and js for vocab lookup. See https://hypotactic.com/apuleius/allap/
- note that the line numbers in the oldfather concordance (based on Helm's Teubner) are included in the word tags in the html, but did not make the transition with complete success. I made a pretty good ocr of the Teubner at archive.org in the hopes of using it to correct those, but haven't yet wrapped my head around that. The ocr text is included here in case someone else wants to try. It's not super important, but it's a pity to lose data.

I've also included a csv version (greatly simplified, only the Met.) of the Bridge's digital concordance, and a csv of my own html data for comparison.
